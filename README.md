## Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website.
It’s where I showcase my work, the kind of problems I like solving, and how I approach building things on the frontend.

I kept the focus on clarity and structure rather than over-engineering. Clean UI, readable code, and a stack I actually enjoy working with.

### What you’ll find here

* A short introduction about me
* Selected projects with brief context
* Skills and tools I work with
* Ways to get in touch

### Tech stack

* React
* TypeScript
* CSS (or Tailwind, if you’re using it)

Built with modern frontend practices, but without unnecessary abstraction.

### Why I built this

I wanted a portfolio that reflects how I think as a developer.
Intentional choices, clean structure, and code that’s easy to reason about.

This repo will keep changing as I improve and build better projects.
